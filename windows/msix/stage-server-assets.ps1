.SYNOPSIS
  Builds the backend + web app and stages everything the embedded-server
  Windows client needs — Postgres, a portable Node.js runtime, the built
  NestJS backend, and the built Next.js web standalone output — into
  $StageDir\server\, ready for build-windows-msix.ps1 to fold into the
  .msix package. Windows-only (matches build-windows-msix.ps1's own
  constraint) — reference run is windows-msix.yml's windows-latest job.

.DESCRIPTION
  Backend: staged via `pnpm deploy --prod` (pnpm's own tool for a correct,
  self-contained production node_modules for one workspace package) — see
  the "Stage backend" section's own comment for why an earlier hand-copied
  mirror of apps/backend/Dockerfile's COPY list couldn't correctly resolve
  prisma's multi-level pnpm dependency graph. Web: still mirrors apps/web/
  Dockerfile's COPY layout directly, since that's just the already-
  self-contained Next.js standalone build output, not a raw pnpm tree.
  Either way, the result still contains pnpm's normal internal symlink
  structure (real NTFS reparse points, since this runs on Windows) —
  directory copies use dereference-copy.js via Copy-DirectoryRobust below,
  which follows those into their real target content, because makeappx.exe
  (the actual MSIX packer) cannot pack a source tree containing real
  reparse points at all (see Copy-DirectoryRobust's comment for why
  Copy-Item -Recurse, then robocopy, then fs.cpSync were each tried and
  replaced before landing on this).

.PARAMETER StageDir
  Output root — server assets land in $StageDir\server\...

.PARAMETER RepoRoot
  Monorepo root. Defaults to two directories up from this script
  (windows/msix/../..).

.PARAMETER DownloadCacheDir
  Where the portable Node.js/Postgres zips are downloaded to. Re-used
  across runs if already present (idempotent) — point this at a CI cache
  directory (actions/cache) to avoid re-downloading ~80MB every run.

.EXAMPLE
  ./stage-server-assets.ps1 -StageDir ./out/stage

# --- 2. Stage backend via `pnpm deploy` -------------------------------------
# Hand-copying apps/backend/node_modules (mirroring the Dockerfile's own
# COPY list — the approach this replaces) repeatedly failed to correctly
# resolve prisma's multi-level dependency graph. pnpm's non-hoisted layout
# resolves EACH package's own dependencies through ITS OWN
# .pnpm/pkg@version/node_modules/ context — require('@prisma/engines')
# from prisma's own files resolves through ANOTHER such context nested
# inside @prisma/engines's own store folder, and so on recursively.
# Manually copying/guessing which nested contexts to preserve turned into
# an unwinnable one-missing-module-at-a-time chase (@prisma/engines, then
# @prisma/debug, then the unrelated `effect` package). Reclassifying
# `prisma` from a devDependency to a real dependency (see that
# package.json commit) was necessary but NOT sufficient on its own either
# — `pnpm prune --prod` at the workspace root still silently removed
# apps/backend/node_modules/prisma's symlink specifically (confirmed
# directly: the real content survived in the .pnpm store, only the
# symlink pointing to it got deleted), even though prisma is correctly
# classified as production in both package.json and the lockfile.
#
# `pnpm deploy` is pnpm's own purpose-built tool for producing a correct,
# complete, self-contained production node_modules for exactly this
# scenario (one workspace package, deployed standalone) — confirmed
# directly: its output runs prisma's CLI correctly with zero manual
# patching, sidestepping whatever exactly made in-place pruning misbehave
# by building a fresh node_modules from scratch instead. `--legacy` avoids
# needing an `inject-workspace-packages=true` pnpm-workspace.yaml change
# pnpm v10+ otherwise requires for deploy.
