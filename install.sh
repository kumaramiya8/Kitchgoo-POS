# One-click installer for Nodedr OrderRestro (nodedr-restaurant-pos).

# Run this from the repo root after cloning:
#   ./install.sh
#
# Generates a .env with random secrets (only if one doesn't already exist),
# builds the backend + web Docker images, starts the stack, and waits for the
# backend to come up (migrations run automatically on container start). Safe
# to re-run any time (after `git pull`, to rebuild) — nothing here overwrites
# an existing .env or destroys existing data.
#
# Pass --demo to also load seed data (a sample restaurant, menu, and a
# owner@demo.local login) for trying the app out. Without it, sign up your
# own restaurant at /signup — no demo data is created.
