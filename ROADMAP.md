# Roadmap / Living TODO

Checkboxes are the actual status — trust these (and `git log`) over prose in
`PROJECT.md`. Update this file at the end of every work session.

For the full public-facing feature taxonomy (POS/billing, tables, KDS,
inventory, CRM, payments, security, AI, etc. — ~305 line items each marked
Shipped/Partial/Planned against the real codebase) see
[`FEATURE-CHECKLIST.md`](./FEATURE-CHECKLIST.md). This file tracks the same
ground phase-by-phase for engineering; that one is organized by product
category for anyone (including the website) that wants "what does OrderRestro
actually do today."

## Current phase: 5–8 core features shipped (see each phase for what is and is not built)

Started 2026-08-03. Phases 0-3 finished and verified the same day. Phase 4's
core (ingredients, recipe costing, suppliers, purchase orders, GRN,
batch/lot, waste) landed 2026-08-04, automatic ingredient deduction on order
checkout landed later the same day, and procurement depth (vendor
quotations with price comparison, purchase requests, vendor invoices with
payment tracking, supplier performance) landed 2026-08-14 — all verified
numerically/via real Docker end-to-end, not just built — see Session log.
Direct-USB ESC/POS thermal printing (a Phase 8 hardware item) was also
ported from nodedr-pos the same day. A few small Phase-4-adjacent items
remain deliberately deferred — see "Explicitly deferred" for what and why.

---

### Phase 0 — Foundation

- [x] Planning docs (`PROJECT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`)
- [x] Monorepo scaffold (pnpm workspaces + Turborepo). **Deviation:** no
      separate `packages/config` — shared eslint/tsconfig didn't earn its
      abstraction yet with only 2 apps; revisit once a 3rd app needs it.
- [x] `packages/types` — shared Zod schemas/DTOs (permissions, auth, menu,
      tables, orders), built to CJS (`tsc`) so both apps can `require()` it —
      not left as raw `.ts` source (that broke Node's runtime resolution,
      see git history).
- [x] `apps/backend` NestJS skeleton — module-per-domain (`menu`, `tables`,
      `orders`, `kds`, `dashboard`, `restaurants`), Swagger at `/api/docs`,
      versioned routes (`/api/v1`)
- [x] Prisma schema v1 (auth/RBAC + menu + tables + orders/KOT/payments core), PostgreSQL
- [x] Auth: JWT httpOnly cookie login, PIN login endpoint (`pin-login`),
      session bootstrap via `/auth/me`
- [x] RBAC: Role + Permission tables, `@Auth('permission.key')` decorator
      (combines JwtAuthGuard + PermissionsGuard), full permission list seeded
      per role, individually toggleable in the DB
- [x] `apps/web` Next.js skeleton. **Deviation:** route groups ended up as
      `app/login` (public) + `app/(dashboard)/*` (authenticated shell) rather
      than the originally sketched `(auth)`/`(pos)`/`(kds)`/`(order)` groups —
      POS/KDS are just pages inside the one dashboard shell, which is simpler
      and still correct; a public QR-ordering route group is genuinely new
      (Phase 2+), not a deviation.
- [x] Design system foundation — Tailwind v4 theme tokens (wine/burgundy
      primary, full light+dark palettes), shadcn/ui (Base UI) initialized,
      responsive `AppShell` (desktop sidebar + mobile Sheet drawer, verified
      at 390px/1440px + dark mode via real screenshots). **Deviation:** lives
      in `apps/web/components/ui` (standard shadcn location), not a separate
      `packages/ui` workspace — only one frontend app exists so far; extract
      to a shared package when a second one needs the same components.
- [x] Docker Compose (`postgres`, `backend`, `web`), `.env.example`, root
      README — both images built and run for real via `docker compose up`,
      not just written and assumed to work (see Session log for the two
      pnpm-monorepo packaging bugs this caught).
- [ ] Base CI (lint+typecheck+build on push) — `.github/workflows` — not done
      this session, next up.

**Permission list (seed data, granular, matches spec):** view_sales,
create_orders, edit_orders, cancel_orders, apply_discounts, process_refunds,
print_bills, manage_tables, manage_menu, manage_inventory, access_reports,
manage_users, view_financial_reports, export_data — extended per-module as
later phases add domains. Roles seeded: Owner, Administrator, Restaurant
Manager, Cashier, Waiter, Kitchen Staff, Chef, Bartender, Delivery Staff,
Accountant, Inventory Manager — each a named bundle of permissions, but
every permission independently toggleable per role (never hardcoded).

### Phase 1 — Core vertical slice (dine-in POS, end to end) — ✅ DONE

Goal: a real restaurant could open a table, take an order with modifiers,
send a KOT to a kitchen station, see it on a KDS, mark it ready/served, bill
and pay — achieved and verified via real API calls + full Playwright
click-through (login → menu → tables → POS → KDS) against real Docker
containers, not just "it compiles."

- [x] **Menu management**: categories, items (name, price, tax rate,
      category, kitchen station, veg/non-veg, spice level, allergens,
      availability window), modifier groups + modifiers (price adjustment,
      default selection — pre-selected in the POS picker, max selection),
      table-based CRUD UI (categories sidebar + items table)
- [x] **Floor & table management**: floors, table entity (number, name,
      capacity, status enum, assigned waiter, notes), status changed via a
      dropdown on each table tile. **Scope cut, not silently dropped:** the
      full drag/resize/rotate floor *designer* (dnd-kit) is NOT built —
      `posX`/`posY`/`width`/`height`/`rotation` already exist on the `Table`
      model and the Tables page already renders tiles at those coordinates
      (a real spatial floor view, seeded layout), but there's no UI yet to
      drag a tile and persist a new position (`PATCH /tables/layout` exists
      backend-side, unused by the frontend). Fast-follow, tracked here so it
      doesn't get lost.
- [x] **POS order screen**: dine-in + takeaway, product grid with
      category tabs + search, modifier picker (respects min/max, pre-selects
      defaults), cart with qty stepper, client-side price preview
      (`lib/pricing-preview.ts`, mirrors backend, server always
      re-authoritative on submit)
- [x] **KOT**: generated on order submit, split by kitchen station,
      status flow NEW→ACCEPTED→PREPARING→READY→SERVED(→CANCELLED)
- [x] **KDS**: per-status columns (not per-station columns — see below),
      live elapsed-time timer, warning ring past 15 minutes, bump-to-next-
      status button, real-time via the Socket.IO `RealtimeGateway` (branch-
      room push, not polling) — verified a ticket appear/move without a
      manual refresh. **Scope note:** columns are grouped by KOT *status*
      (New/Accepted/Preparing/Ready), not by kitchen *station* — station
      filtering exists backend-side (`GET /kds/tickets?stationId=`) but the
      frontend doesn't yet offer a per-station view/tab; each ticket does
      show its station name. Fast-follow.
- [x] **Billing/checkout**: tax-inclusive pricing with GST/VAT correctly
      backed OUT (never added on top — verified numerically, e.g. a ₹480
      item at 5% backs out to exactly the right tax, a 10% discount on a
      ₹920 cart lands on exactly ₹828), %/flat discount, cash/card/UPI/wallet
      payment record. **Update (2026-08-04):** receipt printing shipped —
      `GET /v1/orders/:id/receipt` renders a self-printing HTML receipt
      (ported from `nodedr-pos`'s `backend/src/lib/receipt.js` layout rules),
      loaded into a hidden iframe and printed via the browser's own dialog
      (any printer, or "Save as PDF"), triggered by a **Print receipt**
      button on the post-checkout screen. A dedicated PDF-download endpoint
      and direct-USB ESC/POS printing (nodedr-pos's other two print paths)
      remain a Phase 8 hardware item.
- [x] **Dashboard v1**: today's revenue, today's orders, table status
      breakdown, kitchen queue counts, recent transactions — bento-grid
      cards, 15s polling refresh (not yet wired to the realtime gateway;
      KDS/tables are, dashboard fast-follow).

### Phase 2 — Kitchen depth + Reservations — ✅ DONE

- [x] Kitchen stations were already first-class config (Phase 1). Added this
      phase: reprint KOT (`POST /kds/tickets/:id/reprint`, increments
      `printedCount`), priority toggle (star icon on the ticket card, ring
      highlight same as the 15-min delay warning), kitchen performance
      report (`GET /kds/performance` — avg minutes-to-ready per station
      today, small widget atop the KDS board). **Scope note:** "delay
      alerts" is the existing Phase 1 visual (warning ring past 15 min) —
      no separate push notification was added, the KDS screen itself is the
      alert surface.
- [x] Reservations: customer name/phone/email, guest count, date/time/
      duration, assigned table, special requests, deposit (schema only, no
      payment collection UI yet), full status flow (reserved→confirmed→
      arrived→completed/cancelled/no_show) with table-status side effects
      (assigning a table on create marks it RESERVED, ARRIVED occupies it,
      terminal statuses release it back to AVAILABLE — mirrors the same
      side-effect pattern checkout() uses for dine-in orders). **Scope
      cut:** no reminder notifications (would need Phase 8's SMS/email/
      WhatsApp integrations) — `reminderSentAt` exists on the schema,
      unused.
- [x] Waitlist: name/phone/party size/quoted wait, WAITING→SEATED/CANCELLED,
      seat action assigns a table and marks it OCCUPIED. Lives as a panel
      on the Tables page (not a separate nav item) since seating a waitlist
      guest is a table-floor action.
- [x] Table QR generation (opaque per-table token, rotate/regenerate
      invalidates the old one) + public read-only menu view at
      `/order/[qrToken]` — unauthenticated, no ordering yet (that's still
      Phase 5), verified with both a valid token (renders categories/items/
      veg-nonveg indicator) and an invalid one (empty-state, not a raw
      error page).

### Phase 3 — CRM + Loyalty + Combos — ✅ DONE

- [x] Customer profiles (phone/email/address/birthday/anniversary/
      allergies/notes) + order history + a profile page
      (`/customers/[id]`) showing loyalty balance, store credit, gift
      cards, and paid-order history. Attachable to a POS order via a
      name/phone search-and-attach picker in the cart panel.
- [x] Loyalty: 1 point earned per ₹100 of net spend (floor, excluding tip),
      1 point = ₹1 redeemable discount, redemption capped at the customer's
      actual balance (re-checked inside the checkout transaction, not
      trusted from a pre-transaction snapshot) and at the bill total.
      **Scope note:** the earn/redeem rate is a fixed constant for now
      (`LOYALTY_POINT_VALUE` / `LOYALTY_EARN_PER_CURRENCY` in
      `orders.service.ts`), not yet a per-restaurant configurable program —
      real "memberships" (tiers) are not built, only the points ledger.
- [x] Gift cards: issue (random code + balance), balance lookup, redeem as
      a checkout payment source — debits up to the remaining amount due
      (never more than the card's balance), read-modify-write with
      `round2` + `set` (not a DB `increment`, per this project's standing
      Float-balance discipline). "Gift vouchers" and gift cards are treated
      as the same feature here, not two separate systems.
- [x] Combo meals: a menu item can declare component items + quantities
      (`ComboComponent`, editable via a builder dialog in Menu
      management — the "Layers" icon on each item row). Setting/clearing
      components toggles `MenuItem.isCombo` automatically. **Scope cut,
      not silently dropped:** components are informational/kitchen-facing
      only — a combo still has its own flat selling price, and there's no
      automatic ingredient stock deduction across the bundle yet (that
      needs Phase 4's inventory system to exist first; tracked there, not
      forgotten).
- [x] Billing depth: tips (added on top of the discounted subtotal, not
      taxed), refunds (capped at what's actually refundable — total minus
      prior refunds on that order — with an optional store-credit payout
      that credits the customer's wallet), and merging two open dine-in
      orders into one (moves items + KOTs, recomputes subtotal/tax, cancels
      the source order, releases its table). **Scope cut, documented:**
      "split bill" is a display-only equal-split calculator in the
      checkout panel (shows each guest's share so the cashier can collect
      cash from each), not a system that produces separate checks/receipts
      per guest — this app's Order model finalizes OPEN→PAID as one unit,
      and building true per-guest sub-bills would mean a real data-model
      change, not a quick add. Revisit if a future session needs it for
      real.

### Phase 4 — Inventory & Procurement

- [x] Ingredient-based inventory: raw materials, weighted-average cost per
      unit (recomputed on every GRN), reorder level / low-stock flagging.
      **Deviation:** one base unit per ingredient, no unit-conversion engine
      (buy a 25kg bag, stock/recipe in kg) — see "Explicitly deferred" below.
- [x] Recipes: menu item → ingredient quantities (`RecipeIngredient`), live
      cost computed from current weighted-average ingredient cost and
      snapshotted onto `MenuItem.costPrice` on save.
- [x] Automatic ingredient deduction on order checkout. Deducts via FIFO
      batch consumption inside the checkout transaction, for every order
      item with a recipe modeled (combos expanded one level into their
      component items first). Deliberately **allows stock to go negative**
      instead of blocking the sale — see the Session log entry below for
      the reasoning and the numeric verification.
- [x] Purchase orders (draft → sent → partially received → received /
      cancelled, sequential PO numbers), supplier management, goods
      received (GRN) linked or unlinked to a PO, each GRN line creating a
      batch and a stock-ledger entry.
- [ ] Stock transfers (branch-to-branch) — deferred to Phase 6 (multi-branch
      work needs to land first; a single-branch transfer has no real
      counterpart yet).
- [x] Stock adjustments (manual stocktake corrections, ledgered).
- [x] Waste recording (reason-coded, FIFO-consumed from the oldest batch,
      priced at that batch's own cost — not a blended average).
- [x] Expiry tracking (optional `expiryDate` captured per batch on receipt)
      and batch/lot numbers (auto-generated `GRN-000N-n` or supplier-
      provided). **Deviation:** expiry is stored and visible per batch, but
      there's no automated "expiring soon" alert/report yet — deferred with
      the rest of the alerting/reporting engine to Phase 7.
- [x] Low-stock alerts: `GET /inventory/ingredients/low-stock` + a "Low
      stock" badge on the Ingredients page. No push/email notification yet
      (Phase 7 territory, same as expiry alerts).
- [x] Procurement: vendor quotations, purchase requests, vendor invoices,
      payment tracking, supplier performance — landed 2026-08-14, see
      Session log. Purchase returns and automatic reorder suggestions
      remain out of scope for this pass.

### Phase 5 — Delivery + Online/QR ordering

- [x] Basic QR ordering: place order from the table (`apps/web/app/order/[qrToken]`).
- [x] QR depth (2026-10-04): per-item modifier selection (validated server-side:
      options must belong to the item, group min/max enforced for guest orders),
      call waiter, request bill (staff see them on the Tables page + as
      notifications), live order-status on the QR page.
- [x] Delivery (2026-10-04): delivery zones by pincode (fee, minimum order,
      ETA), driver assignment, status flow (assigned → picked up → delivered /
      failed), delivery history, delivery fee added at checkout, POS Delivery
      order type, `delivery-quote` endpoint in the integration API, MCP tools.
      Branches with no zones keep the old behaviour (no fee, no address check)
      so existing website integrations keep working.
- [x] Scheduled orders (2026-10-04): pick-up/delivery time at least 10 min ahead;
      the kitchen ticket is released ~25 min before the time (per-minute worker).
- [x] Click & collect: online takeaway orders (integration API / POS) with a
      scheduled time.
- [ ] Live GPS tracking of drivers — not built (status tracking only).

### Phase 6 — Staff, Payroll, Accounting, Multi-branch

- [x] Attendance — clock in/out, manager day view (2026-10-04).
- [x] Shift scheduling (overlap + approved-leave checks), leave requests and
      approval, tip distribution (pool split by hours worked), per-staff
      performance report (2026-10-04).
- [x] Payroll: pay profiles (monthly/hourly), draft → finalize runs from clocked
      hours, unpaid-leave deduction, tip share (2026-10-04). No statutory
      deductions (PF/ESI/TDS) — out of scope.
- [x] Accounting: expenses, daily cash closing with variance, profit & loss,
      GST/tax summary by rate (2026-10-04). All report days are cut at the
      restaurant's local midnight.
- [x] Multi-branch: cross-branch overview (sales, open orders, low stock,
      inventory value).
- [x] Bank reconciliation: import a statement CSV (amount or debit/credit
      columns), idempotent re-import, auto-match to expenses by amount +
      5-day window, manual match/ignore (2026-10-11).
- [x] Balance sheet: management snapshot (cash, inventory at cost vs unpaid
      supplier invoices and gift-card balances) — derived from POS records,
      not a statutory double-entry ledger (2026-10-11).
- [x] Budgets: monthly budget per expense category, budget vs actual with
      overspend flags (2026-10-11).
- [x] Branch-to-branch stock transfers: FIFO out of the source, new batch at
      the destination at the cost that left, weighted-average cost updated
      (2026-10-11).
- [ ] Not built: petty-cash, expense approvals, sync agent.

### Phase 7 — Reporting engine, Marketing, Maintenance, Documents

- [x] Reports catalog (18 reports) with date filter, print and CSV export
      (spreadsheet-formula-safe), MCP `run_report` (2026-10-04).
- [x] Analytics: peak hours, food cost & margins, retention (new vs returning),
      slow movers, discounts.
- [x] Marketing: coupons (usage limits, caps, windows), happy-hour promotions,
      campaigns with audience segments, email sending via your SMTP server,
      SMS/WhatsApp via a `campaign.message` webhook, per-customer opt-out.
- [x] Maintenance: equipment + service schedules with overdue/due-soon flags.
- [x] Documents: SOPs, contracts, recipes, purchase paperwork (text).
- [x] Excel (.xlsx), PDF and CSV export for every report (2026-10-11).
- [x] Scheduled report emails: daily / weekly / monthly, xlsx / pdf / csv
      attached, through your SMTP server, 06:00 branch time (2026-10-11).
      Needs `SMTP_URL` + `SMTP_FROM`; delivery to a real mailbox is not
      covered by automated tests.
- [x] File attachments on documents (PDF, image, text, Word, Excel; 5 MB,
      10 per document; stored in the database; always served as a download).
- [ ] Not built: heat-map visualisations.

### Phase 8 — Hardening, integrations, packaging

- [x] Direct-USB ESC/POS thermal receipt printing (2026-08-14).
- [x] Cash drawer pulse with USB receipts for cash payments + test button
      (2026-10-04, unit-tested bytes; not verified on physical hardware).
- [x] Customer-facing display (`/customer-display`, mirrors the POS cart).
- [x] UPI QR payments: restaurant UPI id/payee in settings; checkout shows a
      NPCI deep-link QR for the exact amount due, mirrored full-screen on the
      customer display; payment-received chime (plus spoken confirmation where
      the browser supports it) on the till and the display (2026-10-11). The
      cashier still confirms receipt — there is no bank/gateway callback.
- [x] Two-factor authentication (TOTP + recovery codes; replay and lockout
      protection; PIN login disabled for 2FA accounts; admin reset).
- [x] Audit log coverage extended to payroll, pay rates, leave, expenses, cash
      close, coupons, promotions, zones, webhooks and API keys.
- [x] Backup / restore (already shipped earlier).
- [x] Outbound webhooks: HMAC-signed `order.created|paid|cancelled`,
      `reservation.created`, `delivery.updated`, `campaign.message`, with
      retries and an SSRF guard. This is the integration point for payment,
      accounting, SMS/WhatsApp and delivery-platform tools via any automation
      service.
- [x] SMTP email (campaigns).
- [ ] Not built: native payment-gateway checkout (automatic UPI confirmation
      needs one), direct accounting-software and delivery-platform connectors,
      weighing scale, label printers, barcode scanner, GraphQL API.
- [ ] Not built: SQLite deployment variant (the schema relies on Postgres
      arrays/enums/decimals), Windows/Linux native installers beyond the
      existing MSIX workflow.

## Explicitly deferred / not guessed

Same judgment call `nodedr-pos` made on large government reference datasets
(HSN/PIN/IFSC): anything requiring a large, frequently-revised external
dataset gets a documented import path, not a fabricated snapshot, when we
reach it (tax code masters, delivery-platform rate cards, etc.).

**Phase 4 scope cuts (2026-08-04):**
- **Unit conversion.** Each `Ingredient` has one base unit used everywhere
  (recipe, PO, GRN, stock). A real conversion engine — buy a 25kg bag,
  stock and recipe in kg — is real, non-trivial modeling work (conversion
  factors can be ingredient-specific and sometimes non-linear, e.g. a dozen
  of a piece-counted item vs. a weight-based one) that would have doubled
  the schema surface for this pass. Revisit when a real recipe needs it.
- **Stock transfers.** Deferred to Phase 6 alongside multi-branch, since a
  transfer needs two real branches to mean anything.
- **Expiry/low-stock alerting (push/email/report).** The *data* is
  captured now (`expiryDate` per batch, `reorderLevel` per ingredient,
  `GET /ingredients/low-stock`) — an actual notification/report layer is
  Phase 7 territory alongside the rest of the reporting engine, not
  something to bolt on ad hoc here.

## Session log

- **2026-09-27: Multi-region tax + English/Spanish/French i18n.** Two
  independent features.

  **Multi-region tax.** `Branch` gained `country`, `taxRegime`
  (`INDIA_GST`/`US_SALES_TAX`/`EU_VAT`/`ES_IVA`/`CUSTOM`), `taxMode`
  (`INCLUSIVE`/`EXCLUSIVE`), `taxLabel`, `taxId` (migration
  `multi_region_tax`, additive only — `gstNumber` kept as the India-specific
  field existing installs already populated, used as the fallback tax-id
  display when `taxRegime` is `INDIA_GST` and the new `taxId` is empty).
  Regime presets (display name, default mode, receipt label, tax-id field
  label, whether the receipt splits CGST/SGST) live in
  `packages/types/src/tax.ts` so the API and web app never drift.
  `pricing.ts` gained exactly one new function,
  `toEffectiveInclusiveUnitPrice` — the single point where an
  `EXCLUSIVE`-mode (US Sales Tax) menu price gets grossed up to the
  inclusive figure the rest of the pricing engine has always worked off
  of; `priceLine`/`computeOrderTotals` and every reconstruction site that
  re-derives a line from a stored `lineTotal` (add-items, checkout,
  refund/merge) needed zero changes, since they already worked from an
  already-inclusive stored amount. Both receipt renderers (HTML + ESC/POS)
  now derive their tax label/split from the branch's regime instead of a
  hardcoded "GST"/CGST/SGST, and show a pre-tax subtotal + added-tax line
  instead of an inclusive breakup when the branch is `EXCLUSIVE`. Settings
  gained a Tax section on the branch card: region picker (resets
  mode/country to that regime's own default on change, so switching
  regions can't silently leave a stale mode mispricing every item),
  mode picker, country code, tax-id field (label follows the regime), and
  a receipt-label override. The menu item price field's label now reads
  "Price (incl. tax)" or "Price (excl. tax)" depending on the branch's mode.

  **i18n.** Deliberately *not* `next-intl` (despite that being this
  README's original aspirational entry) — a lightweight client-side
  locale context (`apps/web/lib/i18n`) instead, since this dashboard has
  no per-locale routing/SEO need and a Context + localStorage + browser-
  language-detection is enough for a business tool. Dictionaries for
  en/es/fr live as flat-key JSON files; `t(key, vars?)` does `{var}`
  interpolation and falls back to English then the raw key. Wired up on
  the two highest-value surfaces given the scope of one session: the
  guest-facing QR ordering page (the one screen an actual non-staff
  guest reads) and the staff sidebar navigation, both with a language
  switcher. Extending coverage to the rest of the back-office is
  mechanical from here — same `t("namespace.key")` pattern, add the key
  to all three dictionary files.

  **Verified, with one real limitation to flag.** The dev sandbox this
  work was done in had no route to Prisma's binary CDN
  (`binaries.prisma.sh` — blocked by the environment's network policy),
  so `prisma generate`/`migrate dev` could not be run here. The migration
  SQL was hand-written to match Prisma's own output style exactly and
  applied directly via `psql` against a real local Postgres (all prior
  migrations replayed first) to confirm it's syntactically and
  semantically correct against the actual schema — but **run
  `pnpm --filter @nodedr-restaurant/types build && cd apps/backend && npx
  prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy` for real once, and re-run
  the backend's own test suite, before trusting this in production.**
  `packages/types` and all of `apps/web` (including every file touched
  here) do typecheck clean (`tsc --noEmit`) and lint clean (`eslint`) in
  this sandbox — that part had no such blocker. The backend's own
  `tsc`/tests could not be run here for the same Prisma-engine reason and
  should be treated as unverified until someone runs them with normal
  network access.

- **2026-08-14: Procurement depth + direct-USB ESC/POS printing.** Two
  independent features, both shipped and pushed the same day.

  **Procurement depth** (the Phase 4 item deferred on 2026-08-04): new
  Prisma models `PurchaseRequest`/`PurchaseRequestItem`,
  `SupplierQuotation`/`SupplierQuotationItem`, `SupplierInvoice`/
  `SupplierPayment` (migration `add_procurement_depth`, additive only —
  no existing table touched). Purchase requests get a DRAFT→
  PENDING_APPROVAL→APPROVED/REJECTED status machine. Quotations get a
  `GET /quotations/compare?ingredientId=` endpoint sorted cheapest-first —
  the actual point of collecting more than one. Vendor invoices carry
  payments with the same transactional read-modify-write Decimal-balance
  discipline this project uses everywhere else (never a DB `increment`),
  an overpayment guard, and a status that auto-derives from `amountPaid`
  rather than being set by hand. Supplier performance (on-time delivery
  rate, avg lead time, total spend) is computed on demand from existing
  PO/GRN/invoice data, not a separately maintained metric that could
  drift. New "Procurement" tab in Inventory (three sections: requests,
  quotations, invoices) using the same list+dialog pattern as the
  existing Purchase Orders page. **Verified with real curl scenarios
  against a running Docker stack** (not just unit-level): partial
  payment → `PARTIALLY_PAID`; an overpay attempt correctly rejected;
  paying the exact remaining balance → `PAID`; cancel correctly blocked
  once a payment exists; illegal status transitions on both purchase
  requests and quotations correctly rejected. Frontend verified visually
  via Playwright against seeded data.

  **Direct-USB ESC/POS printing**, ported from `nodedr-pos`'s
  hardware-verified transport (`escposUsb.js`) — same two-transport
  structure (kernel `usblp` character device primary, libusb raw bulk
  fallback), same hardware lessons encoded (vendor-class printers only
  reachable via the kernel device; `usblp` claims the interface so
  libusb needs a kernel-driver detach first). Receipt byte-building
  (`escpos-receipt.ts`) adapted to this app's Order/OrderItem shape,
  reusing the same GST-inclusive backed-out tax math as the existing HTML
  receipt (`receipt.html.ts`) — both now share one `toEscposOrder()`
  mapping in `orders.controller.ts` instead of duplicating the
  Prisma-result-to-receipt-shape logic. New "Print via USB" button next
  to the existing "Print receipt" button on the POS checkout-complete
  screen, plus a Settings → USB thermal printer diagnostics card (device
  detection, send test slip) so staff can verify hardware without ringing
  up a sale. `usb@2.18.0` pinned to the exact version `nodedr-pos` already
  proved working (not npm's newer 3.x major) — per this project's own
  "don't assume latest is compatible" lesson. **Docker toolchain gotcha,
  caught by an actual `docker compose up --build` failure, not assumed:**
  `usb`'s native addon needs `python3 make g++ linux-headers eudev-dev
  libusb-dev pkgconfig` at install time on Alpine even though it ships a
  prebuilt binary — and BOTH `apps/backend/Dockerfile` and
  `apps/web/Dockerfile` needed the toolchain, not just the backend, since
  pnpm's `install --frozen-lockfile` builds every workspace member's
  native addons regardless of which app actually imports the package.
  `device_cgroup_rules` for majors 180 (`usblp`) and 189 (`usbfs`) added
  to `docker-compose.yml`, same least-privilege grant as `nodedr-pos`
  (not full `privileged: true`). **No physical thermal printer in this
  dev environment** — verified structurally instead, the same bar
  `nodedr-pos` itself used before its first real-hardware test: the
  native addon compiling and the backend starting with the module
  loaded; `print/diagnostics`, `print/test`, and `:id/print/usb` all
  returning a clean 503 with an accurate "no printer found" message
  rather than crashing; the ESC/POS byte buffer visually confirmed
  correctly formatted (columns aligned at 42 cols, CGST/SGST split
  summing exactly to the backed-out tax, grand total correct) via a
  direct buffer dump; and a full Playwright click-through (add item →
  checkout → Print via USB) confirming that exact 503 message surfaces
  as a toast in the real UI, not a generic error.

- **2026-08-04 (later same day)**: Automatic ingredient deduction on order
  checkout — the one Phase 4 item deferred earlier that day, picked up as
  "next feature" once the core landed.

  **Design decisions made (this was the actual work, not the wiring):**
  1. **Never blocks the sale.** `consumeStock(..., allowNegative: true)` —
     if modeled recipe demand exceeds available batches, it deducts what's
     there and lets `Ingredient.currentStock` go negative rather than
     throwing. A recipe-modeling gap (most menu items won't have a recipe
     yet) or a mid-service substitution must never be the reason a paid
     food order fails to save; that's a strictly worse outcome than a
     stock figure that needs a stocktake correction later. Waste logging
     keeps the opposite behavior (`allowNegative: false`, blocks) since it
     has no such urgency — same function, opposite defaults, on purpose.
  2. **Combos expand one level.** A combo's own `MenuItem` row essentially
     never carries a direct recipe — deducting only by the combo's
     `menuItemId` would silently skip inventory for every combo sale.
     `InventoryService.deductForOrderItems` expands `isCombo` items via
     `ComboComponent` before resolving recipes. No combos-of-combos in this
     schema (no self-relation on `ComboComponent`), so one level is
     complete, not partial.
  3. **Refunds do not restock.** Deliberately not implemented: if food was
     already prepared and then refunded, the ingredients were still
     consumed — refunding money doesn't un-cook the food. Not a gap, a
     decision.

  **Real refactor, not just new code:** extracted the FIFO batch-consumption
  core (previously duplicated inline in `WasteService`) into
  `StockService.consumeStock`, shared by both waste logging and order
  deduction now. Caught and fixed a real latent bug while doing it: the
  pre-refactor `WasteService`/`StockService.adjustStock` both read
  `Ingredient.currentStock` in a plain query *before* opening the
  `$transaction`, then used that stale snapshot to compute the new value
  inside it — under concurrent requests against the same ingredient,
  Postgres's default READ COMMITTED isolation doesn't protect against a
  lost update there (two concurrent waste-logs could both read the same
  starting stock and the second one to commit silently overwrites the
  first's deduction). Fixed by moving the read to be the first statement
  *inside* the transaction in both places — the same discipline
  `orders.service.ts`'s loyalty-point redemption already used (re-read the
  mutable balance inside the transaction, not before it), just not yet
  applied to the inventory module when it was first built hours earlier.

  **Verified numerically via curl, real scenarios, real orders:** ordering
  2× a menu item with a 0.2kg recipe line against 3kg of stock landed
  stock at exactly 2.6kg; ordering enough of the same item to demand more
  than what remained (20× against 2.6kg) still returned `201` and correctly
  drove stock to exactly -1.4 instead of blocking; an order for an item
  with zero recipe lines checked out cleanly with no errors; a combo built
  live for this test (1× recipe-bearing item + 1× plain item) correctly
  deducted through to the component's recipe on checkout, landing stock at
  exactly the expected value. Also caught and killed an orphaned `nest
  start` process left running from earlier the same session, squatting
  port 4001 — same "check what's actually bound to the port" lesson
  `nodedr-pos`'s memory already recorded once.

- **2026-08-04**: Phase 4 core (Inventory & Store Management) — ingredients,
  recipe costing, suppliers, purchase orders, GRN, batch/lot, waste. Scoped
  to what the user asked for; procurement depth and the items above are
  deferred, not silently dropped.

  **What got built:** Prisma models (`Ingredient`, `RecipeIngredient`,
  `Supplier`, `PurchaseOrder`/`PurchaseOrderItem`, `GoodsReceipt`/
  `GoodsReceiptItem`, `StockBatch`, `StockMovement`, `WasteLog`) plus their
  Zod DTOs in `packages/types/src/inventory.ts`; a NestJS `inventory` module
  (`InventoryService` for ingredients/suppliers/recipe costing,
  `PurchaseOrdersService`, `GoodsReceiptsService`, `WasteService`,
  `StockService` for adjustments/ledger reads) behind the already-seeded
  `inventory.manage` permission; frontend at `/inventory` (tabs for
  Ingredients/Suppliers/Purchase Orders/Waste), a PO detail page with a
  receive-against-PO dialog that pre-fills outstanding quantities.

  **Costing/stock discipline (the actual hard part):** weighted-average
  cost, recomputed on every GRN (`newCost = ((oldStock*oldCost) +
  (recvQty*recvCost)) / (oldStock+recvQty)`), and FIFO waste consumption
  (oldest `StockBatch` first, each batch's own cost carried into the waste
  log — not a blended average). Every cached running total (`Ingredient.
  currentStock`/`costPerUnit`, `PurchaseOrderItem.quantityReceived`) is
  updated via a transactional read-then-`set`, never a DB `increment` —
  the `nodedr-pos` float-drift lesson, applied from the start instead of
  rediscovered later. Verified numerically end-to-end via curl before any
  UI existed for it (see the schema's own inline comment and this session's
  transcript): a 10kg@₹300 GRN then a 5kg@₹360 GRN landed the ingredient at
  exactly ₹320/kg (the correct weighted average); a 0.2kg recipe line at
  that cost priced the menu item at exactly ₹64.00; wasting 12kg correctly
  drained the first batch (10kg@300) fully and 2kg from the second
  (@360), leaving 3kg remaining and the ingredient at exactly 3kg stock;
  over-wasting past available stock correctly 400'd instead of going
  negative.

  **Real bugs/gotchas caught this session:**
  1. `apps/backend/.env`'s `DATABASE_URL` had a stale password
     (`nodedr_dev_pw`) that didn't match root `.env`'s actual
     `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (`change-me`, which is what the running Postgres
     volume was actually initialized with) — local migrations failed with
     an auth error until traced and fixed. Pre-existing drift between the
     two env files, not introduced this session, but worth knowing about
     if migrations mysteriously fail with valid-looking credentials again.
  2. Root `docker-compose.yml` deliberately doesn't publish Postgres to the
     host (only `expose:`, for security) — local `prisma migrate dev`
     needs host access, so a gitignored `docker-compose.override.yml`
     (now in `.gitignore`) adds the port mapping locally without touching
     the committed, intentionally-locked-down compose file.
  3. Same-value-for-two-fields TypeScript inference gotcha: `let
     purchaseOrder = null` infers type `null` forever, not
     `PurchaseOrderWithItems | null` — needed an explicit
     `Prisma.PurchaseOrderGetPayload<{...}>` type annotation. Cheap to miss,
     caught immediately by `tsc`, worth remembering for the next
     conditionally-fetched Prisma relation.

- **2026-08-03**: Repo created from scratch. Planning docs written first
  (`PROJECT.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md`/`ROADMAP.md`/`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`), then
  Phase 0 + all of Phase 1 built and verified in the same session — this
  entry is intentionally detailed since it's the only session so far and a
  future session needs the full picture, not just checkboxes.

  **What got built:** pnpm/Turborepo monorepo; `packages/types` (Zod DTOs +
  permission list, single source of truth for both apps); NestJS backend
  with auth (JWT httpOnly cookie + PIN), a combined `@Auth('permission')`
  guard decorator, and modules for menu/tables/orders/kds/dashboard/
  branches; a `ZodValidationPipe` that had to be fixed to only validate
  `@Body()` (Nest's `@UsePipes()` runs a pipe against *every* parameter,
  including `@Query()` strings, which isn't obvious until a query param gets
  fed into a schema expecting the whole body object); server-authoritative
  pricing (`orders/pricing.ts`) built with the `nodedr-pos` GST-inclusive
  lesson in mind from the start, verified numerically rather than assumed;
  Socket.IO realtime gateway (branch-room push for KOT/table/order events).
  Frontend: Next.js + shadcn/ui (Base UI, not Radix — its trigger components
  take a `render` prop, not `asChild`, and render their own `<button>`, so
  don't nest another button inside one); TanStack Query hooks per domain;
  full Phase 1 UI (login, dashboard, menu, tables, POS, KDS).

  **Real bugs caught by actually running things, not just building:**
  1. The Zod-pipe-validates-every-param issue above (order creation failed
     with a confusing "expected object, received string" until traced to
     `branchId` being run through the body schema).
  2. React's compiler-era ESLint rules (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`,
     `react-hooks/purity` — same family as the `nodedr-pos` `react-hooks/refs`
     issue noted in `[[feedback_nextjs_agents_md]]`) flagged three spots:
     calling `Date.now()` during render in a KDS timer hook (fixed by only
     computing it inside the interval callback), and two "derive state from
     an effect" anti-patterns (modifier-picker defaults, branch
     auto-selection) — both fixed by deriving state during render (a keyed
     child component with a lazy `useState` initializer; a `useMemo` derived
     value) instead of `useEffect` + `setState`. **Recurring lesson for this
     stack:** if new code needs "initialize state from a prop/query result
     that's already available at render time," reach for a lazy initializer
     or `useMemo` first — an effect is for synchronizing with a genuinely
     external system (a clock, a subscription), not for copying already-
     available data into state a tick later.
  3. **Two Docker packaging bugs, only caught by actually running
     `docker compose up` end-to-end** (build succeeding is not sufficient
     evidence — same lesson `nodedr-pos` learned about Prisma/Docker): the
     backend's runtime stage flattened everything to `/app`, which silently
     breaks pnpm's per-workspace `node_modules/.bin/*` symlinks (they're
     relative paths back into the root `.pnpm` store) — `npx prisma migrate
     deploy` then can't find the local `prisma` binary and tries to fetch an
     arbitrary "latest" from the registry instead. Fixed by keeping the
     runtime image's directory depth identical to the workspace
     (`/repo/apps/backend`, `/repo/packages/types`, `/repo/node_modules`),
     not flattening. Same root cause bit `packages/types`' own dependency
     (`zod`) a second time — its `node_modules` (containing the `zod`
     symlink) also needed to be copied alongside its `dist`. **Standing
     lesson for any future Dockerfile touching this monorepo:** when
     packaging a pnpm workspace member for a container, preserve the
     workspace's relative directory structure end to end, or copy each
     package's own `node_modules` explicitly — don't assume a flattened
     `COPY --from=builder /repo/node_modules ./node_modules` is enough.
  4. Test-data hygiene: iterative Playwright runs against the same dev
     database left two abandoned OPEN orders occupying tables, which then
     made a later automated test's "click the first table option" fail
     because that table was (correctly) disabled — not a product bug, just
     accumulated test state. Settled both via the checkout API before
     finishing rather than leaving stray open orders in the seeded demo.

  **Verified, not just written:** full login→menu→tables→POS→KDS
  click-through via Playwright (screenshots at desktop/mobile/dark-mode);
  pricing verified numerically (GST backed out correctly, discount lands on
  the exact rupee); real `docker compose up` with real Postgres, backend,
  and web containers talking to each other, login + dashboard working
  through the web container's `/api` proxy exactly as a real deployment
  would use it.

  **Not done, explicitly deferred (see inline Phase 0/1 notes above):** CI
  workflow, floor drag-to-reposition UI, KDS per-station column view,
  receipt HTML/PDF rendering, dashboard realtime (still polling).

- **2026-08-03 (same day, continued session): Phase 2 — kitchen depth +
  reservations/waitlist/QR.** Added `Reservation` and `WaitlistEntry` models
  (migration `add_reservations_waitlist`); reused `Table.qrToken` (already
  in the Phase 1 schema, unused until now) for QR generation. Backend:
  `ReservationsModule`, `WaitlistModule`, unauthenticated `PublicModule`
  (`GET /public/menu/:qrToken`), plus reprint/priority/performance additions
  to the existing orders/KDS modules. Frontend: Reservations page, a
  Waitlist panel embedded in the Tables page, a QR-code dialog on each
  table tile (`qrcode.react`), the public `/order/[qrToken]` menu view, and
  priority/reprint controls + a performance widget on the KDS board.

  **Verified, not just written:** full Playwright click-through (create
  reservation → change status → confirm table-status side effect; add to
  waitlist → seat → table occupied; generate QR → scan-equivalent visit to
  `/order/[qrToken]` with both a valid and an invalid token; KDS priority
  star + reprint button + performance widget all rendering real data from
  earlier curl-driven test orders) — screenshots taken at each step,
  including one dark-mode pass on the new Reservations page. Backend
  behavior (table status RESERVED→OCCUPIED→AVAILABLE through the
  reservation lifecycle, waitlist seat marking a table OCCUPIED) verified
  via curl against the running Postgres-backed API before any frontend
  existed for it, same discipline as Phase 1.

  **Nothing new broke the recurring lessons from Phase 1** (Zod pipe
  body-only scoping, React derived-state-in-effect) — this phase's code
  was written with those already in mind, not rediscovered. One new
  Prisma-specific gotcha: `Table` has no direct `branchId` column (it's
  reached via `Floor.branchId`), so `rotateQrToken`'s tenancy check needed
  `where: { id, floor: { branchId } }`, not a flat `{ id, branchId }` —
  caught immediately by `tsc`, not at runtime.

  **Not done, explicitly deferred (see inline Phase 2 notes above):**
  reservation reminder notifications (needs Phase 8 SMS/email/WhatsApp),
  deposit collection UI (field exists, no payment flow), QR ordering
  beyond view-only (Phase 5 scope).

- **2026-08-03 (same day, third session): Phase 3 — CRM, loyalty, gift
  cards, combos, billing depth.** New Prisma models: expanded `Customer`
  (address/birthday/anniversary/allergies/notes/loyaltyPoints/
  walletBalance), `GiftCard` + `GiftCardRedemption`, `ComboComponent`,
  `Refund`; `Order` gained `tipAmount`, `loyaltyPointsRedeemed`,
  `loyaltyDiscountAmount` (migration `add_crm_loyalty_giftcards_combos`).
  Backend: `CustomersModule`, `GiftCardsModule`, combo-composition methods
  folded into the existing `MenuService`/`MenuController` (not a separate
  module — it's menu configuration), and a substantial rewrite of
  `OrdersService.checkout()` to layer in tip/loyalty-redemption/
  gift-card-payment/loyalty-earning inside one transaction, plus new
  `refund()` and `mergeOrders()` methods. Frontend: a Customers list +
  profile page, a customer search-and-attach picker wired into the POS
  cart, loyalty/gift-card/tip/split-bill-calculator fields added to the
  checkout panel, a combo-builder dialog in Menu management (a "Layers"
  icon per item row, highlighted when `isCombo`), a refund action on the
  dashboard's recent-transactions list, and a "merge another table's bill
  here" action on occupied table tiles.

  **Verified, not just written:** every new backend capability hit with
  curl first (loyalty earn on a ₹480 order → exactly 4 points at the
  stated rate; redeeming those 4 points on a ₹90 order → exactly ₹86 due
  and balance back to 0; a ₹200 gift card correctly only partially
  covering a ₹220 order, then fully draining across two payment sources;
  a refund correctly capped at "total minus prior refunds," rejecting an
  over-refund attempt; merging two open orders producing the exact summed
  subtotal, cancelling the source order, and releasing its table) *before*
  any frontend UI existed for it — same discipline as Phase 1/2. Then the
  same flows again through Playwright against the real UI (customer
  create → profile page, combo save reflected live in the Layers-icon
  highlight, refund dialog → toast → dashboard revenue update, merge
  dialog → correct target/source table statuses).

  **New recurring-lesson hit, not a new class of bug:** the
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` issue from Phase 1/2 recurred a third
  time in the combo-builder dialog (initializing local editable `rows`
  state from a `useComboComponents` query result). Fixed with the same
  established pattern — a child component keyed by the parent item, given
  a lazy `useState` initializer once the query result is available, rather
  than an effect copying query data into state. Worth calling out
  specifically because it's now happened enough times in this codebase
  that it should be the *default* instinct for "seed local state from
  already-fetched data," not something to rediscover per component.

  **Deliberate scope cuts, decided and documented, not silently
  skipped:** combo components are informational/kitchen-facing only — no
  automatic ingredient stock deduction (needs Phase 4's inventory system
  to exist first); "split bill" is a display-only equal-share calculator,
  not a system that produces separate per-guest checks (the Order model
  finalizes as one unit; real bill-splitting needs a data-model change,
  not a quick add); loyalty program is a single fixed earn/redeem rate,
  not yet configurable per restaurant.
