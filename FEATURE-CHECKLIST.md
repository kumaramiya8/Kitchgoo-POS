# Feature Checklist

Cross-referenced against the actual codebase (`apps/backend`, `apps/web`,
`apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`) as of 2026-08-14, not just roadmap
prose. This is the exhaustive taxonomy version of `ROADMAP.md` (which
tracks the same ground phase-by-phase, engineering-oriented) — organized
here by product category for public/roadmap use. Where a feature is
partially built, the note says what's missing.

## Summary

Rough counts across all 29 categories (line-item granularity, not
category granularity), updated 2026-08-14 after procurement depth and
direct-USB printing shipped: **~100 Shipped, ~29 Partial, ~176 Planned**
out of ~305 line items in the pasted taxonomy.

**Closest to complete (of the 10 core modules):**
1. **Tables / Floor Plan** — full status lifecycle, reservations, waitlist, QR tokens, shape-aware icons; missing mainly the drag-to-reposition designer UI and table-level analytics (turnover, revenue/seat).
2. **Purchasing** — core PO/GRN/supplier flow plus the full procurement-depth layer (quotations with price comparison, purchase requests, vendor invoices with payment tracking, supplier performance) shipped 2026-08-14; missing purchase returns, price-variance, and automatic reorder suggestions.
3. **Kitchen / KDS** — status columns, timers, priority, stations, performance widget, sound alerts all real; missing per-station column view, expediter screen.
4. **POS / Billing** — correct India tax model, discounts, tips, refunds, combos, merge, and now direct-USB thermal printing alongside browser print; missing split payment, item-level discounts/notes, hold/draft orders, digital/WhatsApp receipts.
5. **Inventory** — genuinely deep (weighted-average costing, FIFO waste, batch/expiry, auto-deduction); missing yield/wastage-% reporting.

**Furthest from complete:**
1. **Kiosk / QR Ordering** — QR *viewing* exists, but no ordering, payment, or self-service kiosk mode at all.
2. **Analytics** — only a summary + trend widget exists; the entire reports catalog, exports, and KPI breakdowns are unbuilt.
3. **Payments** — methods are recorded, but no live payment-gateway/UPI-QR collection, no split payment.
4. **Customers/Loyalty** — a real points ledger exists, but no tiers, campaigns, segmentation, or coupons.
5. **Menu / Recipes** — solid (modifiers, combos, allergens, recipe costing); missing time-based/seasonal menu sets and per-branch menus.

Entirely unbuilt as standalone categories: **Delivery, Cash Drawer
Management, Marketing, Accounting, AI Features, Self-Service Kiosk.** All
six are either an explicit later ROADMAP phase or, for AI/Kiosk, not yet
scoped into any phase at all.
